# Cpp-Projects-
Hello i am Yash Siddhpura. I have developed some projects using C++ Language.
<br>

<p>
Project 1: Currency Converter<br> 
Description: This code is for a simple currency converter application implemented in C++. It allows users to convert between seven different currencies: US Dollar, Indian Rupees, Pound Sterling, Euro, Japanese Yen, Kuwaiti Dinar, and Swiss Franc. Overall, the code provides a basic currency conversion functionality with a user-friendly interface.<br>
Note: This program is made using basic C++ concepts.

Project 2: Quiz Application<br>
Description: This C++ program is a movie quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge on various movie categories: Marvel, DC, Hollywood, and Bollywood. The quiz for each category is presented with multiple-choice questions, and the player's answers are evaluated to calculate the score. The game keeps running until the user decides to quit.
Note: This program is made using basic C++ concepts.

Project 3: Online Shopping<br>
Description: The provided C++ code implements an online shopping system for various electronic products, including mobile phones, laptops, desktops, speakers, and headphones. The system allows users to: Select a category of products they wish to purchase, Choose specific items within that category, Enter the desired quantity for each selected item. The program then calculates the total bill amount and the quantity of each type of product purchased. A summary of the total bill and individual category bills is displayed when the user chooses to exit the system.<br>
Note: This program is made using C++ concepts.

Project 4: Airline Reservation<br> 
Description:  This C++ program connects to a MySQL database and manages an airline reservation system. This program demonstrates basic database operations (insertion, selection, and update) using the MySQL C API, integrated with a simple command-line interface for managing an airline reservation system.<br>
Note: This program is made using C++ OOP concepts. Also DATABASE Connectivity is implemented.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Project 5: PhoneBook Management System<br>
Description: This C++ program implements a simple Phone Book Management System that allows users to add and search for phone numbers. It features a `PhoneBook` class with private attributes for storing the name, phone number, and address of a contact, along with public setter and getter methods to manipulate these attributes.<br>
Note: This program is made using C++ OOP concepts. File handling is also implemented.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Project 6: Student Report Card <br>
This C++ program interacts with a MySQL database to manage and update student report cards. The program uses `mysql_query` to execute SQL commands and handles possible errors during database operations. It also ensures proper resource management by freeing the MySQL result set after use. The use of `stringstream` ensures proper conversion of numerical values to strings for SQL queries. The program includes basic error handling and user input validation to ensure smooth operation.<br>
Note: This program is made using C++ OOP concepts. Also DATABASE Connectivity is implemented.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Project 7: Registration & Login Form <br>
Description: This C++ program implements a simple console-based registration and login system. The program allows users to register by entering a login ID and password, which are then saved to a file. Users can later log in using their credentials. This program demonstrates basic file handling, string manipulation, and user interaction in C++.<br>
Note: This program is made using C++ OOP concepts. File handling is also implemented.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Note: Run all the above codes in " CodeBlocks ".<br>
      All these codes are working porperly without any errors.<br>
      Use DevC++ for Project 4 & Project 6 as i have built database connection using it. Database connection is made using MYSQL Workbench.
